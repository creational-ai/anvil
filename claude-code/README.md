# Claude Code Skills

Skills for the **implementation phase** of Anvil, designed for Claude Code (CLI).

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **design** | 5-stage design workflow (Vision → Architecture → Roadmap → Milestone Spec → Task Spec) |
| **dev** | 3-stage development loop (Design → Plan → Execute) |
| **research** | Market validation and naming research |
| **review** | Quality assurance (doc review + skill review) |

## Installation

```bash
# Deploy skills and commands to ~/.claude/
./deploy.sh

# Verify deployment
./verify.sh
```

## Workflow

```
DESIGN PHASE (design skill)
─────────────────────────
/design-vision              → Vision document
        ↓
/design-architecture        → Technical design
        ↓
/design-roadmap             → Strategic roadmap
        ↓
/design-milestone-spec      → Detailed milestone spec
        ↓
/design-task-spec           → Atomic tasks with dependencies

DEVELOPMENT PHASE (dev skill)
─────────────────────────────
/dev-design                 → Analyze task (NO CODE)
        ↓
/dev-plan                   → Plan implementation steps
        ↓
/dev-execute                → Execute one step with tests
        ↓ (or)
/dev-execute-run            → Run all steps to completion (auto-finalize)
        ↓
/dev-finalize               → Wrap up (timestamp + lessons + diagram + health)
        ↓
Repeat for next task
```

## Most Common Workflow

The typical dev task workflow with review loops:

```
1.  /dev-design <description>                Design analysis (no code)
2.  /review-doc-run <design doc> --auto      Review until solid (repeat as needed)
3.  /dev-plan <design doc>                   Create implementation steps
4.  /review-doc-run <plan doc> --auto        Review until solid (repeat as needed)
5.  /dev-execute-run                         Execute all steps + auto-finalize
6.  /dev-review-run <results doc>            Conceptual review of completed work
```

**Steps 2 and 4** are iterative — run reviews until all items are clean, fixing issues between rounds. The `--auto` flag auto-applies suggested fixes.

**Step 5** runs all plan steps sequentially, then auto-finalizes (timestamp, lessons, diagram, health check).

**Step 6** is optional but recommended — catches intent drift, silent assumptions, and architectural issues across the completed implementation.

## Output Files

**design skill creates:**
- `docs/[slug]-vision.md`
- `docs/[slug]-architecture.md`
- `docs/[slug]-roadmap.md`
- `docs/[slug]-milestone-spec.md`
- `docs/[slug]-task-spec.md`

**dev skill creates:**
- `docs/[milestone]-[task]-design.md`
- `docs/[milestone]-[task]-plan.md`
- `docs/[milestone]-[task]-results.md`
- `docs/[milestone]-milestone-summary.md`

**research creates:**
- `docs/[slug]-market-research.md`
- `docs/naming-research.md`

## Key Principles

- **design skill is NO-CODE** — Pure design and planning
- **dev skill allows code** — Stage 1 is design-only, Stages 2-3 allow code
- **One task at a time** — Plan and execute incrementally
- **Production-grade quality** — OOP, Pydantic, type hints, tests required
- **Self-contained work** — Each item works independently
- **200-users-first** — Right-sized for early users, scale comes later
