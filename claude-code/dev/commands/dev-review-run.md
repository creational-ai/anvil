# /dev-review-run

Review all completed steps in parallel by spawning a `dev-review-agent` for each.

## Input

**Required**: Path to results document
- File path: `docs/[milestone-slug]-[task-slug]-results.md`
- Task name: `core-poc6` → looks for `docs/core-poc6-results.md`

**Examples**:
```bash
/dev-review-run docs/core-prefab-manager-results.md
/dev-review-run core-prefab-manager
```

## Process

**You are the orchestrator. Follow these steps exactly:**

### 1. Setup

1. Resolve the results path (if task name given, convert to `docs/[name]-results.md`)
2. Read the results doc to find all completed steps (status: ✅ Complete)
3. Find the corresponding plan doc (linked at top of results doc)
4. Read the plan doc's Overview table → extract the **Risk Profile**

### 2. Spawn Reviews in Parallel

For each completed step, spawn a `dev-review-agent` in background. Each agent writes to its own temp file in the session scratchpad — agents never touch results.md.

**Temp file pattern**: `[session-scratchpad]/review-step-{N}.md`

Use the session scratchpad path from the system prompt. If no scratchpad path is available, fall back to `/tmp/`.

```
Spawn dev-review-agent (run_in_background: true):
"[results-doc-path] step [N]

output: [session-scratchpad]/review-step-[N].md

Write your review to the output file above. Do NOT write to results.md."
```

Launch ALL review agents in a single message — do not wait between spawns.

### 3. Collect and Merge (stream as they finish)

**Do NOT wait for all agents.** Use `block: false` polling to check each agent, merge whichever is done, then loop back for the rest.

```
remaining = [all spawned agent IDs]

while remaining is not empty:
  for each agent_id in remaining:
    check agent_id with TaskOutput (block: false)
    if done:
      1. Read [session-scratchpad]/review-step-{N}.md
      2. Insert **Review** section into step {N} block in results.md
      3. Report to user: "Step {N} review: PASS/FLAG"
      4. Remove agent_id from remaining
  if remaining is not empty:
    wait briefly, then poll again (block: true, timeout: 15000 on first remaining agent)
```

**Format for results.md** (adapt from agent output, add timestamp):
```markdown
**Review**: ✅ Pass / ⚠️ Flagged
**Reviewed**: [ISO 8601 with timezone, e.g., 2026-02-24T12:09:07-0800]
- **Architectural drift**: ✅ / ⚠️ — [one sentence]
- **[other checks if applied]**: ✅ / ⚠️ — [one sentence]
- **Advisory**: [if any]
```

The **Reviewed** timestamp is the time the orchestrator merges the review into results.md. Run `date "+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z"` to get it.

### 4. Update Summary Table

After all reviews are merged, update the **Reviewed** field in the Summary table at the top of results.md:

```markdown
| **Reviewed** | [ISO 8601 with timezone] |
```

Run `date "+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z"` to get the timestamp. This records when the full review pass completed.

### 5. Report Summary

After all agents have completed, all reviews merged, and Summary table updated:

```markdown
## Review Summary

**Task**: [task-name]
**Steps Reviewed**: [count]
**Risk Profile**: [from plan]

| Step | Name | Verdict |
|------|------|---------|
| 0 | [name] | PASS / FLAG |
| 1 | [name] | PASS / FLAG |
| ... | ... | ... |

**Result**: All PASS / [N] flagged

[If any FLAG:]
### Flagged Issues
**Step [N]**: [issue summary from review agent]
```

## Key Rules

1. **All reviews in parallel** — spawn all agents in a single message with `run_in_background: true`
2. **Temp file per agent** — each agent writes to `[session-scratchpad]/review-step-{N}.md`, never to results.md
3. **Orchestrator merges** — only the orchestrator writes to results.md
4. **Write as they arrive** — as each agent completes, read its temp file and merge immediately
5. **Only review completed steps** — skip steps that are Pending or In Progress
6. **Report all results** — even if all PASS, show the summary table
