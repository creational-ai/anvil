## Process

1. Read the guide (listed above)
2. Identify document type from filename pattern
3. Load cross-reference docs automatically
4. Check template alignment
5. Run type-specific checks
6. Run universal checks (soundness, flow, dependencies, contradictions, clarity, surprises)
7. Verify against codebase
8. WebSearch for external sources if needed
9. Generate verification report
10. Offer to apply fixes

## Output Format
