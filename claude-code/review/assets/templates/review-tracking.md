## Structural Properties

- **First review**: Creates the entire document -- header, summary tables with R1 column, all detail sections with R1 entries, holistic sections with R1 entries, review log with R1 row.
- **Subsequent reviews**: Adds a new column (R2, R3, ...) to summary tables, appends new timestamped entries to each detail section, appends holistic entry, adds review log row.
- **[Item/Step/Task] placeholder**: Substitute based on document type: Design -> Item, Plan -> Step, Task Spec -> Task.
- **Summary table cells**: Show issue counts using severity labels (e.g., `1 HIGH 2 MED`) or `✅` for sound. `...` in summary table cells indicates review is in progress (agent still running). Replaced with issue counts or `✅` when the agent completes.
- **Detail entries**: Timestamped per review. Issues use `- [SEV] Description -> Suggested fix` format. Sound items show single-line "Sound" entry.
- **Recurring/regressed annotations**: Added inline in detail entries (e.g., `[Recurring from R1]`, `[Regression from R2]`). Recurring annotations include prior fix context: `[Recurring from R1 -- prior fix: <summary>; root cause: <why it persists>]`.
- **Skipped fix annotations**: Added inline when a fix is not applied: `[Skipped: reason]`. Common reasons: `user declined`, `already correct`, `ambiguous target`, `outside document scope`.
- **Holistic section**: Same summary/detail pattern as items but organized by concern area.
- **Review Log Status values**: `Clean` (no issues found) / `Pending` (issues found, no fixes applied) / `Applied (X of Y)` (issues found, some/all fixes applied).
